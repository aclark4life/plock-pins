# Usage notes
# ------------------
# the expected use of this pin is in a PNDK 
# heroku.cfg file for deployment to heroku
# see: http://tinyurl.com/plone-newbie-dev-kit 
# a typical heroku.cfg file would look like this:
#
#     [deploy]
#     user = admin:<strong password should be placed here>
#     packages =
#               example.staffprofile
#     [buildout]
#     extends =
#              https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/deploy-heroku
#  
#

[deploy]
user = admin:changetheadminpassword
packages =

[buildout]
extends =
    https://raw.github.com/plock/pins/master/plone-4-3

# pypi_local is a PNDK convention
# a local directory for locally developed production packages
# see PNDK documentation at http://tinyurl.com/plone-newbie-dev-kit
